## What crosses the wire between the game and the server, in both directions: Godot values
## as JSON-safe dictionaries, and JSON back into the values a property or parameter wants.
##
## The conversion itself is the shared one, so a value read off a running game is spelled exactly
## as the same value read off the editor or off a headless engine. What is here is the part that is
## only true of a running game: reaching a node by path, and fitting an argument to the type the
## method it is going to declares.

## The node [param path] names under [param root], or a refusal saying why there is not one.
##
## The other direction of what a node serialises as, and here for that reason: a node crosses the
## wire as its path, so a path crossing back is a node or it is nothing. One answer for every op,
## because each of them read a path for itself and they could disagree about what one means.
##
## A colon is the disagreement worth its own sentence. Godot reads everything after the first one
## as subnames and [method Node.get_node_or_null] drops them, so "/root/Main:_game:run" was quietly
## answered about "/root/Main", and an op that then said the path had no method `advance` was right
## about an object nobody had asked for. Colons reach through what a node holds, and the arguments
## that take them are the property and the method.
